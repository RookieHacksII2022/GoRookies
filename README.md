## Notable featuers
### Usage in chat groups
While the main purpose of the quiz app is to create quick and simple quizlets for your own use, the bot also has a social feature, allowing users to share their quizzes with their friends. This allows for users to study together for tests and exams.

In addiiton to being a useful study aid, goQuizBot can also be used for more entertaining purposes, such as creating "about me" quizzes to see how well your friends know you.

While using in chat groups, goQuizBot is able to focus on the inputs of one user, allowing other users to provide commentary while their friends attempt their quizzes.

### Custom keyboards
We took advantage of Telegram's custom keyoard feature to provide custom keyboards where ever possible, to make navigating goQuizBot as easy as a click of a button.
